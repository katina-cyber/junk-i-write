# 2. What is computer - on the quest to be hacker

>But what it do?
>-one of my CS instructors in college

In my first two years of college, I majored in Computer Science. 

This is when I didn't know that *technically* Information Security and Computer Science aren't really the same thing. 

The introductory, obligatory, "Intro to Comp Sci 1+2" courses were basically just, "here is how you can code some basic stuff," which I found frustrating, because I dabbled a lot in programming in high school. This is what unfortunately started to inject a "HA! I already know this material, you inferior vermin" mindset into my head, which is really unhealthy, by the way, if you're actually trying to learn something. So I would say curriculum wise - I didn't learn much from the courses I took in school. 

What *did* end up helping me is all the outside goofing off, learning about different technologies, at least on a really basic level. Things like git, vim, python scripting - these are some of the things that helped me get a job. And also, too many hours worked in food service and retail - helping me to become a better communicator along the way. 

But you know what **we never ended up going over in class, ever?!?!?!?!**

This question, below this line of text here:

## What is computer?

Yeah, you know what, what is computer? What is it? What it do? 

You mean to tell me that in your first two years of school studying Computer Science, no one ever talked about what a computer was? And you were studying **Computer Science??**

I think it's an assumption, a bad one, that we all make when we decide to study Computer Science - that we all already know what a computer is. If you decide to study Computer Science in college, then you have probably used a computer at least once. You might have written a few programs, or maybe you heard that it was a good field to get into and you needed to major in something. You can argue that you probably take a class in which you learn about the innards and different parts of a computer, which is true - but have you actually ever talked about, at least on the most basic level, what *the fuck the thing you're studying actually is?* 

Before I tell you what a **computer** is, let's look at some other words in the English language first, and take a go at figuring out what they mean. 

**Runner** - A person that runs
**Farmer** - A person that farms
**Sprinkler** - A thing that sprinkles something (usually water)

We see that in these words, we add -er to the end of some word to describe a thing that does the thing, or has something to do with the thing we tacked on -er to the end of.

So, we know that a RUN-ner, runs, and a FARM-er, farms, and a SPRINK-ler sprinkles (something, usually water but with enough persistence you can sprinkle anything your heart desires). 

Knowing this, we can break down the word computer.

**COMPUTE-er** - A thing that computes

Let's break down the word even further. What does it mean "to compute" anyway? Well, a quick Google search brings up the following as the definition of "compute:"

>verb
>calculate or reckon (a figure or an amount)
>*alternatively*
>make a calculation, especially using a computer

Okay, so the first definition we see has the word "calculate" in it. What does "calculate" mean? Let us reference a Google search once more.

>verb
>determine (the amount or number of something) mathematically.

Now we know that a computer is a thing that computes, and to compute something means "to determine (the amount or number of something) mathematically." 

So, a computer does a bunch of math. And when it does this math, then we can get it to help us do stuff! Then, all of this stuff you're studying in a Computer Science degree, is a bunch of the complicated math inside of a computer that lets us do cool stuff. Like go on the internet! And find information about how to bake a cake! Or learn something new!
